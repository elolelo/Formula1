### Disclaimere:

1. I used expo-cli instead of react-native-cli not because I am not familiar with mobile development using react native but becuase I have recently got a new mac and the set up of android and xcode took a while and was unsuccessful at the end. So, expo was easier to get up and running with the task

2. My 2 favorite teams did not return players/drivers details - so instead it kept asking me to subscribe (when I already have subscribed). required me to have subscribed to the formula 1 API - which I already had suscribed but the call did not return the expected instead it returned the shown below:

### The app
- There is an .apk file for the android devices 
- There is also an .ipa file for iOS devices 

### How to start
- Clone the project
- Start by running the `npm install` 
- Then run expo command : `expo start`  

###  Building commands
- used `expo build:android` for android
- used `expo build:ios` for ios
